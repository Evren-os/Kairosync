# Hyprland Configuration

This repository contains my personal, partial Hyprland configuration based on the [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) project. It is tailored for my own use and may require adjustments for your setup. For a complete and tested configuration, please refer to the original HyDE repository.
