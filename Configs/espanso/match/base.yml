      Based on my PC specifications, mpv configuration, and mediainfo data provided above, perform the following analysis:

      1.  Identify the single file with the absolute peak technical quality, considering all key metrics like video bitrate, resolution, codec, bit-depth, and color space, as well as audio quality (codec, channels, bitrate).

      2.  Determine if my system can play that top-tier file with perfect, stutter-free smoothness.

      3.  Based on your findings, provide a single, definitive recommendation.
          *   If the top-tier file is playable, recommend it.
          *   If not, you must instead recommend the file with the highest technical quality from the list that my system *can* play perfectly.

      Your final output should be just one, single, definitive file recommendation without any other options.

      When you're searching for information or trying to find answers, could you please focus on getting details from these types of places? It's really important that the information is authentic, accurate, and directly relevant:

      *  Reddit : Look for helpful subreddits, specific posts, and insightful comment threads. Analyze what redditors saying, suggesting and discussing.
      *  Official Channels : Prioritize official resources, and official community forums.
      *  Trusted Independent Sources : Seek out well-regarded websites, established blogs, and articles from known, trustworthy publishers.
      *  Expert & Developer Insights : Pay attention to reviews, analyses, or discussions from genuine developers, users or recognized experts in the field.

      On the other hand, please make a strong effort to completely **avoid** using information from random, unverified, or generally untrustworthy sources.

      A few guidelines for your response:

      1.  **Accuracy is my top priority.** Please provide information that is factual, verified, and up-to-date as of {{current_date}}. Avoid any speculation, assumptions, or fabricated details. If you don't know an answer or a fact cannot be confirmed, please state that clearly.

      2.  **Be comprehensive but concise.** I want all the important details and information, but without any fluff, filler, or repetitive phrasing. Get straight to the point.

      3.  **Clarity and organization are key.** Please structure your answer in a logical, easy-to-follow way. Use headings, lists, or bold text if it helps make the information clearer.

      4.  **Write in a natural, conversational style.** The tone should be easy to read and understand, but don't simplify the content itself. Assume you're explaining things to an intelligent adult who just appreciates clear, straightforward writing.
