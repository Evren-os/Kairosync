      Your role is to act as an expert media analyst. Your primary, non-negotiable goal is to identify the single file from the list above that represents the absolute pinnacle of audiovisual quality.

      **1. The Definitive Selection:**
      First, analyze the provided MediaInfo for each file. Compare them directly against one another to determine which version offers the most technical and visual supremacy. Your evaluation should consider quantitative metrics (bitrate, resolution, color depth, audio fidelity) and qualitative factors (visual integrity, freedom from compression artifacts, and the preservation of fine-grain detail).

      Your choice must be based purely on this pursuit of ultimate quality. My hardware's capabilities are not a limiting factor in this selection.

      **2. The Playback Forecast:**
      After you have locked in your recommendation, provide a brief, subordinate forecast of the playback experience on my system. This analysis is for my information only and must not influence your primary selection.

      Based on my specs and `mpv.conf`:
      *   **Performance:** Comment on the expected playback smoothness, noting any potential for stutter from high CPU/GPU decoding demands.
      *   **Visuals (Tone Mapping):** If the recommended file contains HDR metadata, predict the character of the tone-mapped image on my SDR display (e.g., will colors likely appear balanced, over-saturated, washed out, or darker than intended?).
      *   **Audio:** Confirm compatibility, noting if the primary audio track will be downmixed to stereo for my headphones.

      Your final output must be a single, definitive recommendation, followed by a concise justification for your choice.

      Task : Rewrite the prompt enclosed in the curly braces below.
      Key Goals :
      * Make it sound natural and human (not robotic).
      * Optimize for maximum clarity and easy AI understanding.
      * Refine for specificity and to eliminate ambiguity.
      * Keep all original information and intent intact.
      Required Output Formats :
      1. Present **only** the final rewritten prompt enclosed in a markdown code block.
         * **Fence type (conditional):**
           **~~~** if the original prompt **or** rewritten prompt contains a standard code block (```...```).
           **```** otherwise.
         * **Content:** Complete, purely formatted Markdown of the rewritten prompt (preserve all formatting).

      Here is the original prompt to rewrite :
      {}

      When you're searching for information or trying to find answers, could you please focus on getting details from these types of places? It's really important that the information is authentic, accurate, and directly relevant:

      *  Reddit : Look for helpful subreddits, specific posts, and insightful comment threads. Analyze what redditors saying, suggesting and discussing.
      *  Official Channels : Prioritize official resources, and official community forums.
      *  Trusted Independent Sources : Seek out well-regarded websites, established blogs, and articles from known, trustworthy publishers.
      *  Expert & Developer Insights : Pay attention to reviews, analyses, or discussions from genuine developers, users or recognized experts in the field.

      On the other hand, please make a strong effort to completely **avoid** using information from random, unverified, or generally untrustworthy sources.

      A few guidelines for your response:

      1.  **Accuracy is my top priority.** Please provide information that is factual, verified, and up-to-date as of {{current_date}}. Avoid any speculation, assumptions, or fabricated details. If you don't know an answer or a fact cannot be confirmed, please state that clearly.

      2.  **Be comprehensive but concise.** I want all the important details and information, but without any fluff, filler, or repetitive phrasing. Get straight to the point.

      3.  **Clarity and organization are key.** Please structure your answer in a logical, easy-to-follow way. Use headings, lists, or bold text if it helps make the information clearer.

      4.  **Write in a natural, conversational style.** The tone should be easy to read and understand, but don't simplify the content itself. Assume you're explaining things to an intelligent adult who just appreciates clear, straightforward writing.
